# Changelog

## [3.1.0](https://github.com/seolcu/hostveil/compare/v3.0.0...v3.1.0) (2026-07-20)

This is the first release cut from `main` since v2.6.0, and the first produced
by the automated release pipeline. The `v3.0.0` tag was published from a
rewrite branch that never merged, so this release — not that one — is what the
v3 line actually is.

The sections below were generated from conventional-commit history, which for
this window covers only part of the work: the rewrite landed under `P0:`–`P8:`
prefixes that carry no commit type, so it is summarised here by hand. Later
releases will not need this note — pull request titles are linted now, and
merges to `main` are squashed, so the generated sections are the whole story
from here on.

### Highlights

* **Rewritten around a single engine.** `internal/core.Engine` owns scanning,
  scoring, classification, preview, apply, and rollback; the CLI, TUI, and web
  dashboard are rendering layers over it, enforced by tests that fail if UI
  code reaches past it. A fix applied in any of the three behaves identically
  and is reversible from any of them.
* **New detection domains** beyond containers and SSH: open ports, user
  accounts, file permissions, and self-hosted AI agent runtimes.
* **CVEs are reported per image**, with a rollup finding you can act on,
  instead of one finding per CVE.
* **Scoring no longer bottoms out.** Findings erode an axis multiplicatively
  rather than summing into a clamp, so a host with 27 container findings no
  longer scores the same as one with 3.
* **A scan that could not look no longer reports a clean result.** Partial
  coverage is representable and surfaced as a degraded axis, closing the path
  by which a non-root scan once reported a perfect CVE score.
* **Rollback from every surface** — a history screen in the TUI and reversible
  applied fixes in the web dashboard.
* **Compose fixes render as minimal text edits** rather than a whole-file
  re-encode, so a one-line change stays a one-line diff.
* **Auto-elevation**: commands that benefit from root re-exec under sudo
  instead of failing.
* **Website generated from a single source** (`cmd/sitegen`), with a docs site,
  client-side search, and a Korean localization.
* **Reproducible demo VM** (Vagrant) for exercising the tool against a
  deliberately vulnerable host.
* **Releases ship an SBOM and build provenance attestation.**

### Features

* add an agent domain for self-hosted AI agent runtimes ([f4ceb90](https://github.com/seolcu/hostveil/commit/f4ceb906e399d28c133e7095395442ba631aa7de))


### Bug Fixes

* define when a fix may be Auto, and stop the registry overruling it ([66f590b](https://github.com/seolcu/hostveil/commit/66f590b7cbdf110d923dd349aa3f521906de272e))
* do not call any interpreter process an agent gateway ([e37455b](https://github.com/seolcu/hostveil/commit/e37455bb749aa6ff0bbb074771e948db839cf078))
* enumerate the registry instead of a hand-kept list ([302713b](https://github.com/seolcu/hostveil/commit/302713beefc311f817942da560474c3c0c4c38b6))
* give fileperms a chmod that can be rolled back ([236b8b7](https://github.com/seolcu/hostveil/commit/236b8b7f651e64f8d173791b7fcb27da6a870152))
* keep type bits when tightening a mode ([4268e20](https://github.com/seolcu/hostveil/commit/4268e20d341d6a57770bbe01dbaa393289bd185c))
* register the CVE image rollup and a memory-limit fix ([06d6beb](https://github.com/seolcu/hostveil/commit/06d6bebcc1fdc1d5c17ca55e0ca79f99e7c6b72e))
